**** Nitrogen Web Framework ****

Installation Steps
==================

1. Copy or check-out Nitrogen into a subfolder called nitrogen-master of 
   $ERL_LIBS. So if $ERL_LIBS is /opt/erlang-libs/ then copy to 
   /opt/erlang-libs/nitrogen-master. 

2. Change to $ERL_LIBS/nitrogen-master and run 'make' to build Nitrogen.

3. Create a symlink to the nitrogen script to a bin directory in your path:

   sudo ln -s $ERL_LIBS/nitrogen-master/support/nitrogen \
    /usr/local/bin/nitrogen

4. Start a new project in a folder of your choosing with the command:

    nitrogen create myfirstweb

5. Visit http://nitrogenproject.com/ for documentation and help.


Note On $ERL_LIBS
=================

If you do not have the $ERL_LIBS environment variable add the following line 
to ~/.profile or ~/.bash_profile depending on your computer setup:

    export ERL_LIBS=/opt/erlang-libs/

Of course change the path to the location you wish to use. Install other 
modules, such as mochiweb, yaws, erl-mysql and any other you may need, in a 
subfolder of $ERL_LIBS as well.
