{description, "
	This action tells Nitrogen to listen for a client side
	event, and take some action when the event is triggered.
	<p>
	An event action can trigger a postback to the server, a block of Javascript,
	other actions, or any combination of the three.
	<p>
	If the 'postback' attribute is defined, the page will post back to the event/1 function
	with the postback value as the sole attribute. This postback value can be any Erlang term.
	<p>
	If the 'actions' attribute is set (inherited from action base), then these actions will
	be run when this event is triggered. This attributed can be set to a list of actions, a single
	action, or an Erlang string, which will be run as Javascript.
	<p>
	Within the Javascript, you can use obj('id') where id is the id of a Nitrogen element. You can
	also use obj('me') to refer to the target of the current action.
