{description, "
	Run some plain Javascript.
	<p>
	You can access Nitrogen elements within the Javascript using the obj('id') function.
	<p>
	For example, if you have a Nitrogen element with the id of 'myTextBox', 
	then \"var tb = obj('myTextBox');\" will make tb point to the myTextBox element.
	<p>
	In addition, you can use obj('me') to point to the target of the current action, and 
	you can use 'parent' to get the parent of an element, for example: \"obj('me.parent.parent')\".
